# Hacker News App

Using the api that [Hacker News](https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/) provides I built a simple service that fetches all the stories available, with some limitations of course. A working example lives on [codepen](https://codepen.io/yapalexei/full/WxOdwy/). **Note:** the example may differ slightly from the source as I had to slim it down and add a few things for display.

## Clone / Install / Serve

do these steps to run the project
```
> git clone https://github.com/yapalexei/hacker-news.git
> cd hacker-news
> npm install
> bower install
> grunt serve
```

One thing to not is are a few key mappings that one could use.
```
leftArrow     Go to previous story category.
rightArrow`   Go to next story category.
Esc           Return to main menu.
```
